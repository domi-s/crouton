# Crouton, your favourite screensaver

Crouton is a playful web-based screensaver that randomly places crouton images across your screen. Watch as the screen gradually fills with crunchy, golden croutons while a counter keeps track of the total.

## About
Crouton was created as a fun project I created a while ago. The project was inspired by the idea of a screensaver that would fill the screen with croutons, a popular salad topping. The project was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

You can use this project to learn the basics of web development, and I encourage you to experiment with the code and make it your own: add multiple images of croutons, make them different sizes and rotations, or even place something else on the screen. Why not cat images?

## How It Works

- Generates random positions for crouton placement
- Animated appearance of each crouton
- Real-time counter display
- Screen fills until completely covered
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
